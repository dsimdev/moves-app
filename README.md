## Periods

Movements are grouped into periods with a start/end date and declared salary. The active period is the main unit of analysis. Report KPIs compare periods against each other.

## Google Sheets Sync

The app is the source of truth. On sync, it overwrites the `Movimientos` sheet of the configured spreadsheet, keeping up to 5 automatic backups as tabs named by date (Argentina time).

## Theme

Light mode by default, with dark mode toggle. Color variables are applied without flash via inline script in `<head>`. No theme library dependency.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` | Firebase public configuration |
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | Firebase Admin service account (for API routes) |
| `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | Google Sheets service account |
| `GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID` | Target spreadsheet ID |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION` | Auto-generated from `package.json` via `next.config.ts` |
