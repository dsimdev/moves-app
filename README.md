### Reports (`/reportes`)
Period analysis with configurable toggles per section. Tabs:
- **Gastos**: KPIs (total, average, daily pace, trend), by category, by description, by payment method, by date, period comparison
- **Ingresos**: total income, salary evolution, by category, by description, savings breakdown
- **Movimientos**: movement frequency KPIs by type, top descriptions, by category, by day of week, by payment method
- **Períodos**: historical series chart, comparative KPIs (best/worst period, average), income evolution

### Settings (`/config`)
- Categories, payment methods and savings origins (CRUD)
- Preferences: dark/light mode, enable Reports section, enable Investment section

## Periods

Movements are grouped into periods with a start/end date and declared salary. The active period is the main unit of analysis. Report KPIs compare periods against each other. Period and year selectors support multi-select (long press) for cross-period analysis.

## Google Sheets Sync

The app is the source of truth. On sync, it overwrites the `Movimientos` sheet of the configured spreadsheet, keeping up to 5 automatic backups as tabs named by date (Argentina time).

## Theme

Light mode by default, with dark mode toggle. Color variables are applied without flash via inline script in `<head>`. No theme library dependency.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` | Firebase public configuration |
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | Firebase Admin service account (for API routes) |
| `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | Google Sheets service account |
| `GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID` | Target spreadsheet ID |
